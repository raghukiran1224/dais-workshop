As neural networks gain importance with several successful applications of them, this paper raises the question of how they can be applied in the context
of coalition operations. A key challenge in military coalition operations is that of energy and severe bandwidth constraints. We address this challenge by
exploring the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and splitting them across multiple edge nodes. Further, we explore the idea of using spiking neural networks
that can lower the energy consumption significantly. Preliminary results show that both these approaches can have significant impact on coalition operations.
